Dzianis is a detail-oriented, reliable, and skilled engineer with a satisfying level of automation testing expertise. He successfully applied his solid tech skills at work and contributed to the success of the project in many different ways, such as creating test scripts, defining/adjusting JIRA workflows, putting together a large number of confluence documents, constantly bringing new ideas to the scrums meetings,  applying Agile methodology to everyday routine and so on.
